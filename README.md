👋 Hi, I’m Will Reynolds! 📸

🛩️ As an Air Force veteran, I've had the incredible opportunity to serve my country and embark on numerous adventures. Now, I'm on a new journey, transitioning from my passion for photography to the exciting world of software development. 🚀

🎓 I'm currently a dedicated student, immersing myself in the latest web technologies to build creative and functional websites. My current focus is on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—three pillars of front-end development that I'm eager to master. 💻

📚 Alongside my web development studies, I'm also proud to have achieved certifications in Azure Administration (AZ-104) and CompTIA Security+. These accomplishments reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my interest in cloud and security technologies. ☁️🔒

🔍 My goal is to leverage my diverse skillset and love for problem-solving to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on meaningful projects, and contribute to the tech community. 🌟

📫 Feel free to reach out to me—I'd love to chat, share ideas, and explore opportunities for collaboration! 🤝
