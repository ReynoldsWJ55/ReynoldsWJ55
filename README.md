👋 Hi, I’m Will Reynolds! 📸

🛩️ As an Air Force veteran, I've had the incredible opportunity to serve my country and embark on numerous adventures. Now, I'm on a new journey, transitioning from my passion for photography to the exciting world of software development. 🚀

🎓 I'm currently a dedicated student, immersing myself in the latest web technologies to build creative and functional websites. My current focus is on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—three pillars of front-end development that I'm eager to master. 💻

🔍 My goal is to leverage my diverse skillset and love for problem-solving to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on meaningful projects, and contribute to the tech community. 🌟

📷 Unleashing My Creative Side 🌍

Beyond the world of code, I'm a passionate travel photographer with an eye for capturing the beauty and diversity of our planet. Through my lens, I strive to tell visual stories that evoke emotions and inspire wanderlust. My photography journey has taken me to breathtaking locations, where I've had the privilege of documenting people, cultures, and landscapes.

🖼️ Showcasing My Work 🎨

I'm excited to share my art and vision with the world through my photography portfolio website: [www.WJRVisuals.com](https://www.WJRVisuals.com). Built and coded by me, WJR Visuals is a testament to my creative and technical skills working in harmony. The website features a curated selection of my photographic work, and I'm incredibly proud of how it represents my identity as both an artist and a developer.

Whether you're interested in my code or my compositions, I'd love to hear from you. Let's connect, collaborate, and create! 🤝


📫 Feel free to reach out to me—I'd love to chat, share ideas, and explore opportunities for collaboration! 🤝
