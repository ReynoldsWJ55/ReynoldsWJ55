## Hi, I'm Will Reynolds!

I’m a Thailand-based business development, marketing, and operations leader with over 20 years of global experience — including more than five years living and working in Bangkok. A retired U.S. Air Force veteran, I specialize in driving operational excellence, cross-cultural stakeholder engagement, and digital growth strategies across Southeast Asia.

I’m passionate about building innovative, high-performance web solutions with clean code, modern design, and strong market impact. Whether it’s front-end development, digital marketing, or international business strategy, I bring a structured, adaptive approach tailored to the fast-evolving landscape of Thailand and the ASEAN region.

I’m currently pursuing an MBA in Bangkok, expanding my expertise in marketing, digital transformation, and strategic leadership.
