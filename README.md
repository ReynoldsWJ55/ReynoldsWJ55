## Hi, I'm Will Reynolds!

As an Air Force veteran, I've had the incredible opportunity to serve my country and embark on numerous adventures. Now, I'm on a new journey, transitioning from my passion for photography to the exciting world of software development.

My current focus is on HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”three pillars of front-end development that I'm eager to master.

Alongside my web development studies, I'm also Microsoft Azure Administrator Certified. I have experience managing Azure resources and overseeing the deployment and maintenance of web applications on the Azure platform. Additionally, I'm responsible for ensuring the smooth operation and security of these resources.

My goal is to leverage my diverse skillset and love for problem-solving to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact. In addition, I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on meaningful projects, and contribute to the tech community.

Feel free to contact meâ€”I'd love to chat, share ideas, and explore opportunities for collaboration!
